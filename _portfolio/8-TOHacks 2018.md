[Job Joe](https://devpost.com/software/job-joe) is a company search bot that allows Canadians talent to see the perks of companies. We analyzed _ why _ exactly Canadians would leave the country, and decided that it was because they had concerns regarding their company. What if the wages werenâ€™t as high, what if there was no opportunity in Canada? Companies can input their answers to these common questions so that worried employees can ask Job Joe.

We created an Android application with Java using the IBM Watson API for chatbot responses. We used the IBM Watson example project as a base and built our app from there.
