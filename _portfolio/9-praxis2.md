I recently redesigned a communication system for a long-term care home in downtown Toronto. My work involved developing an Arduino circuit and code to manage a speaker system and changing colored buttons.

The redesign of the communication system allowed nurses and residents to communicate more effectively and efficiently, improving the overall quality of care in the long-term care home. The Arduino circuit and code that I developed were instrumental in making this redesign possible, allowing the system to operate smoothly and reliably.

My work on this project demonstrates my expertise in developing solutions for healthcare and long-term care settings, as well as my technical skills in programming and circuit design. I am confident that my experience and skills make me an ideal candidate for any organization that is looking to improve its communication systems and enhance the quality of care it provides.
