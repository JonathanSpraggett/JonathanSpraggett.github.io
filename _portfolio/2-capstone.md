This undergraduate capstone project focuses on the design and development of a drone for nuclear safety inspections. The drone is equipped with computer vision object detection technology to enable it to read critical data from radiated zones. In addition to object detection, the drone is also equipped with localization technology for precise waypoint motion planning. This allows the drone to accurately navigate through the radiated zones, collect and analyze data, and provide important insights into the safety of the site. The project aims to develop a robust and efficient drone solution that can improve the safety and reliability of nuclear inspections while reducing the risk to human inspectors. The capstone project is an opportunity for students to apply their technical skills and knowledge in the fields of computer vision, localization, and drone design to tackle a real-world problem in the field of nuclear safety.
