As a member of a team that participated in the FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) in 2017, I collaborated with 20 other students, teachers, and mentors to build a robot named "Woody" in just six weeks. This robot was designed to compete in the FIRST Steamworks game, and it featured a number of unique and innovative design elements.

During the project, I was responsible for prototyping and testing several different models of a launcher system that was capable of accurately shooting wiffle balls into 8-ft high goals. I also developed a winching mechanism that allowed the robot to climb a 6-ft rope, and I contributed to the development of the code and circuitry necessary for the robot to operate.

Our team was awarded the Creativity Award Sponsored by Xerox at an Ontario District Event for our work on Woody. This award recognized our team's ingenuity in building a cost-efficient robot that was comprised almost entirely of wood, resulting in a unique and innovative design.

Overall, my experience collaborating on this FRC project has given me valuable experience in teamwork, problem-solving, and robotics engineering. I am confident that my skills and knowledge make me an asset to any team working on a similar project.
