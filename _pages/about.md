Welcome to my portfolio website, a platform that showcases my love for robotics and AI. As a Bachelor of Applied Science student in Engineering Science at the University of Toronto, I have developed my skills in areas such as machine learning, computer vision, and robot modeling and control. My proficiency in these areas is highlighted by my role as the project manager and software team lead of UTRA Robosoccer, Canada's first undergraduate-led humanoid robot team.

My research interests in robotics focus on reinforcement learning, computer vision, and localization. I have employed reinforcement learning algorithms, including Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Adversarial Imitation Learning, to train humanoid robots in tasks such as walking, jumping, and kicking, resulting in improved stability, accuracy, and performance. My experience in computer vision encompasses writing object detection and segmentation software to extract crucial information from the surrounding environment, as well as localization techniques using an Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) to fuse odometry, IMU orientation, point clouds, and field landmarks for precise robot localization.

I am thrilled to share my experiences and accomplishments in the field of robotics and AI, and I invite you to delve into my portfolio to learn more. Whether you're interested in my technical expertise, leadership skills, or research interests, you'll find everything here!
